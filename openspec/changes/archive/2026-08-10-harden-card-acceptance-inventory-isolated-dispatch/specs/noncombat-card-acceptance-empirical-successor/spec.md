## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A successor entrypoint is proven in exact isolated dispatch
Before authority publication for a successor inventory identity, the system
SHALL execute a side-effect-free dispatch check using the registered
interpreter, working directory, isolated-mode flag, and seed-inventory script
path. The check SHALL import the configured control module from its fixed
repository path and emit a deterministic canonical binding without reading
authority artifacts, Git evidence, candidate blobs, or seeds and without
creating receipt, staging, output, cohort, or registration artifacts.
The binding SHALL include the normalized interpreter, working directory,
script path and digest, validated command tuple, isolated-mode state, control
module and path, and experiment-contract digest.

#### Scenario: Exact isolated dispatch succeeds
- **WHEN** the fixed seed-inventory script runs `check-dispatch` through the registered interpreter and `-I` entrypoint
- **THEN** it exits successfully with canonical evidence binding the complete process tuple, script identity, configured control module and path, and experiment contract digest

#### Scenario: Dispatch identity drifts
- **WHEN** the interpreter, working directory, command, script identity, isolated mode, configured module, resolved module path, or repeated canonical output drifts
- **THEN** successor authority publication remains blocked before request, source, receipt, output, or seed access

#### Scenario: Dispatch check passes
- **WHEN** the exact isolated dispatch check and its no-side-effect regressions pass
- **THEN** the result establishes only source-entrypoint readiness and grants no inventory invocation, registration, native, model, environment, training, evaluation, gameplay, qualification, or promotion authority
