## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Inventory build start is durably one-shot
After all pre-start authority and source validations pass, `build-inventory`
SHALL atomically persist a canonical request-bound started receipt before
historical path discovery, blob reads, or seed discovery. An existing or partial
receipt SHALL block every later invocation of the same request regardless of
output or staging state. The receipt SHALL remain immutable after success or
failure.

#### Scenario: First invocation fails before publication
- **WHEN** an authorized inventory invocation writes its started receipt and then fails during historical source processing before output or staging publication
- **THEN** a second invocation with the same request is rejected before source discovery and cannot resume, retry, replace, or repair the consumed identity

#### Scenario: A partial receipt already exists
- **WHEN** the request-bound started path contains an empty file, truncated JSON, or invalid canonical receipt from an interrupted first invocation
- **THEN** every later invocation is rejected before source discovery and the existing bytes are preserved without parsing, repair, replacement, or deletion

#### Scenario: Validation fails before start
- **WHEN** authority, source inventory, pushed ancestry, tracked cleanliness, output absence, or request identity validation fails before receipt creation
- **THEN** no started receipt, historical path discovery, blob read, seed discovery, cohort materialization, or output publication occurs

#### Scenario: Inventory publication succeeds
- **WHEN** the started request builds and publishes its inventory successfully
- **THEN** the immutable receipt remains as separate execution evidence and does not grant verification, registration, training, or downstream authority

### Requirement: Terminal inventory predecessor requires a distinct preregistered identity
After an authorized inventory identity terminates in failure, the successor
control plane SHALL preserve that identity and SHALL require a separately
reviewed source commit, request id, output root, request, approval,
authorization, and launch observation before another inventory identity can
start. A predecessor request, approval, authorization, or launch artifact SHALL
NOT authorize the successor identity.

#### Scenario: Distinct r2 passes every pre-start gate
- **WHEN** r1 is terminal, the pushed receipt-hardening source and path preflight are exact, r2 output and receipt are absent, and fresh r2 authority artifacts validate
- **THEN** the system permits at most one r2 `build-inventory` invocation with no native, model, environment, training, evaluation, or gameplay authority

#### Scenario: Predecessor or identity artifact is substituted
- **WHEN** r2 uses an r1 request, approval, authorization, or launch binding, or any registered r2 source, request id, path, digest, or authority field drifts
- **THEN** the system stops before blob reads, seed discovery, cohort materialization, or output publication

#### Scenario: The r2 invocation fails after start
- **WHEN** the sole r2 build invocation reaches any terminal failure
- **THEN** the system preserves a reviewed failure, creates no registration, and does not retry, resume, tune, or replace the identity

#### Scenario: The r2 invocation succeeds
- **WHEN** r2 publishes exactly one inventory and a distinct read-only verification reconstructs the same source registry, exclusions, rows, and cohorts
- **THEN** the system may publish one all-false registration for exactly 512 training, 128 canary, and 512 holdout seeds without granting training or downstream execution authority
